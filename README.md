# FFMPEG-M3U8-list-to-MP4
A simple bash script that reads a file with the title and url of the videos desired to be downloaded and then saves them as MP4.
---

It's quite easy to use!
First, save a text file with all the file names and links you wish to download each in a line. e.g:\
\
FOLDER=folder_name_1 [OPTIONAL]\
file_name1\
url1\
file_name2\
url2\
file_name3
url3\
FOLDER=folder_name_2\
file_name_4\
url4\
...

---
Then open it in shell like this:

$ ffmpeg-m3u8-mp4.sh #read_filename (#output_folder) ( -prefix | -noprefix )" ( -nobeep | -singlebeep | -repeatbeep time_in_seconds )

* ( )=Optional
* #=Not Literally
